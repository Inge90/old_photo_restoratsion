# Old Photo Restoratsion
A small AI script for restoring old photos.

Make this read me fail: My grandparents were in a loving and happy marriage for 56 years. They truly loved each other. There is only one photo from their wedding day, taken 70 years ago. I wanted to restore this photo using an AI script. I wrote a script that helped enhance the image by improving brightness, sharpening the details, and reducing some of the scratches from the old picture. The original photo is named "old_photo.jpg" and, after processing, the result is "restored_photo.jpg".
